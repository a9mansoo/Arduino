# Faux Engineer

Welcome to the adventures of a faux engineer and his Arduino Uno!

This project encompasses:

- Creating different circuits
- Aggregating data from sensors
- Thinking of ways to use the Arduino board

I begged my sister to buy it for me so I could continue my dream of being a faux engineer.
